# podpub — instructions for Claude

This is a lightweight CLI (`podpub.py`) that publishes NotebookLM audio episodes to a private podcast RSS feed hosted on GitHub Pages. The feed URL is `https://synthyclaw.github.io/podpub/feed.xml` and is served via the `itunes:block=yes` directive (hidden from Apple's public directory, but subscribable by URL).

## Publishing workflow

When the user asks to publish, inspect `inbox/` and follow this procedure:

1. **Identify pairs.** For each audio file (`.m4a` / `.mp3` / `.wav`) not already prefixed with `NNN - `, check whether there is a companion file with the same basename:
   - `.md` sidecar present → use it as-is. Skip to step 3.
   - `.pdf` present but no `.md` → generate the `.md` from the PDF (step 2).
   - Neither → the script will auto-generate a generic `"Episode N of …"` description. Ask the user if that's acceptable before running, or if they want to provide a description.

2. **Generate `.md` from PDF.** Read the PDF with the `Read` tool, then write a file at `inbox/<same basename as audio>.md` following the format in the next section. Do not proceed to publish until the `.md` exists.

3. **Preview, then publish.**
   - First run: `.venv/bin/python podpub.py --dry-run` — sanity-check the rename plan, feed XML, and commit message.
   - If everything looks right, run: `.venv/bin/python podpub.py` — this moves files into `audio/`, rebuilds `feed.xml`, commits, and pushes to `origin/main`. GitHub Pages auto-deploys within ~30 seconds.

4. **Delete the PDF(s) after publish.** Once `podpub.py` succeeds, `rm` the source PDF from `inbox/`. The user's standing preference is a clean inbox — do this without asking. If you're not sure publishing succeeded, leave the PDF and flag it.

## Standardized episode description format

The `.md` sidecar becomes the `<description>` in the RSS feed. It is visible in Apple Podcasts and every other podcast app. Use this exact structure:

```
<Paper / book / article title> (<Month Year of publication>)

In this episode we unpack <1–2 sentences: authors, institution if notable, page count if notable, and the central argument or thesis>.

We walk through <specific technical contributions: models, frameworks, methods, benchmarks — cite them by their actual names>, <concrete case studies, datasets, or findings>, and close on <broader implications, open questions, or ethical tensions>.

Reference: <Full APA-style citation>. <DOI or arXiv URL>

Google Scholar citations: <number>
```

### Rules (non-negotiable)

- **Tone**: first-person plural ("we"), present tense. This matches NotebookLM's two-host deep-dive style.
- **Length**: exactly two paragraphs of prose + a Reference line + (optionally) a Google Scholar citations line. No headings, no bullets, no code blocks inside the description.
- **Opening paragraph**: name the authors (or lead author + "et al." for long lists), state where it was published if notable (arXiv, journal, conference), and give the core claim in plain language. Avoid jargon in the thesis sentence.
- **Middle paragraph**: name technical contributions by their real names — model names, benchmark names, framework acronyms. Do not substitute generic phrasing like "various models" where the paper actually names V-JEPA 2-AC, IntPhys 2, etc.
- **Reference line**: APA-ish — "LastName, F., Second, L., Third, L., et al. (Year). Title. Venue or arXiv:ID. URL". For arXiv papers, include both the ID and the full URL.
- **Google Scholar citations**: include this line only if the user explicitly provides the number or if it's easily retrievable. Never guess. If unknown, omit the line entirely.

### Multi-paper episodes

When the inbox contains more than one PDF paired with a single audio file (the audio's basename may not match either PDF — that's fine; use the audio's basename for the `.md` file), the episode is a *thematic pairing*. Keep the structure at two prose paragraphs, but:

- **Title line**: for two or three papers, combine the titles with `+` and each paper's month/year, e.g. `Paper One Title (2005) + Paper Two Title (2024)`. For four or more papers, do **not** concatenate every title — it becomes unreadable in Apple Podcasts. Instead, synthesize one short descriptive title that captures the thread, taking direct inspiration from the audio filename (it doesn't have to match the filename word-for-word, just align with it), and put the collective year range in parentheses, e.g. `Audio filename → episode title`: `Why_physical_robots_need_social_intelligence.m4a → Why Physical Robots Need Social Intelligence (2021–2025)`. The individual paper titles still get named in the opening paragraph and in the Reference lines, so nothing is lost.
- **Opening paragraph**: introduce both papers, their authors and affiliations, and the thread that connects them. State the pairing's argument, not each paper's in isolation.
- **Middle paragraph**: walk through each paper's named contributions in turn — do not blend them into abstractions. Close on the synthesis.
- **Reference block**: one `Reference:` line per paper, back-to-back. Podcast clients render as plain text with line breaks, so two references read cleanly in Apple Podcasts.

### Extracting from a PDF

The `Read` tool handles PDFs directly. For long PDFs (>10 pages), pass a `pages` parameter (e.g., `pages: "1-8"`) — the abstract, introduction, and contributions section are usually all that's needed. Pull:

- **Title** → opens the description (with Month/Year in parentheses).
- **Author list + affiliations** → compresses into the opening sentence.
- **Abstract** → primary source for the opening paragraph's thesis.
- **Introduction / Contributions section** → for the middle paragraph's named artifacts.
- **DOI / arXiv ID** → from the front matter for the Reference line. Common filename-to-DOI patterns you can verify against the paper's footer or URL: arXiv uses `YYMM.NNNNN` (e.g., `2410.00037.pdf` → `arXiv:2410.00037`, Oct 2024); Nature News & Views uses the `d41586-*` prefix (e.g., `d41586-021-01170-0.pdf` → `10.1038/d41586-021-01170-0`); Nature Machine Intelligence uses `s42256-*` (e.g., `s42256-025-01005-x.pdf` → `10.1038/s42256-025-01005-x`); MIT Press journals often use the article ID as the DOI suffix (e.g., `1064546053278973.pdf` → `10.1162/1064546053278973`).
- **Publication month / year** → from the front matter or the arXiv ID (e.g., `arXiv:2506.22355` → June 2025). If only the year is verifiable (older journal articles without a clear month), use just the year — never invent a month.

Reference example — a real one from the first episode:
```
Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World (June 2025)

In this episode we unpack a 40 page position paper from Meta AI Research, led by Pascale Fung with Jitendra Malik and 19 co-authors. The argument: the next generation of AI agents will not live in chat windows. They will be embodied as virtual avatars, as wearables like Meta's AI Glasses, and as robots, and none of them will be useful without a proper world model.

We walk through the three agent types, the case for joint embedding predictive architectures like V-JEPA 2-AC and Vision-Language World Models over pure generative approaches, and the distinction between physical world models (perception, motion, planning) and mental world models (the Theory of Mind layer needed for real collaboration). We also cover the four new benchmarks the paper introduces (MVP, IntPhys 2, CausalVQA, WorldPrediction), and close on lifelong embodied learning, multi agent collaboration, and the ethical tensions around privacy and anthropomorphism.

## Commands reference

- `.venv/bin/python podpub.py` — publish new inbox items (moves files, rebuilds feed, commits, pushes).
- `.venv/bin/python podpub.py --dry-run` — preview without writing or pushing.
- `.venv/bin/python podpub.py --no-push` — commit locally but skip `git push`.
- `.venv/bin/python podpub.py --rebuild-feed` — re-emit `feed.xml` from existing items without processing the inbox. Use after editing `config.yaml` (show title, description, cover URL) so the feed picks up channel-level changes.

## Layout notes

- **Root (served by GitHub Pages)**: `feed.xml`, `audio/`, `NotebookLM-PodPub-Cover.png`. Don't move these — their URLs are baked into `feed.xml`.
- **`setup/`**: `requirements.txt`, `config.yaml.example`. Setup-only, not touched day-to-day.
- **`inbox/`**: user's drop zone. Contents gitignored (including PDFs).
- **`config.yaml`** (gitignored, at root): paths + podcast metadata. Read by `podpub.py` on every run.

## One-time setup (only needed on a fresh clone or new machine)

If `config.yaml` does not exist, the project has not been initialized yet. Walk the user through, in order:

1. **GitHub repo + Pages**. Repo must exist on GitHub; in its Settings → Pages, Source = "Deploy from a branch", branch = `main`, folder = `/ (root)`. Feed URL will be `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/feed.xml`. `git push` must work non-interactively (SSH key or credential helper).
2. **Cover art**. Square PNG/JPG at repo root (1400×1400 minimum). `NotebookLM-PodPub-Cover.png` ships in the repo; replacing it is fine but keep the filename (or update `cover_image_url` in `config.yaml`).
3. **Python deps**. `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r setup/requirements.txt`.
4. **First run**. `.venv/bin/python podpub.py` — prompts for paths, base URL, and podcast metadata; writes `config.yaml`. See `setup/config.yaml.example` for the schema.
